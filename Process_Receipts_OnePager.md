# Panther Trolley Tracker — Process Receipts (One Pager)

**Problem / POV**  
Students waste time waiting with no reliable trolley ETA. We reduce uncertainty and missed rides for freshmen/sophomores who rely on campus transit.

**Top pains (from survey/interviews)**  
- No trustworthy ETA → wasted time and stress  
- Missed rides due to late/unclear updates  
- Uncertainty when GPS is down or route changes

**Top gains**  
- One-glance “next two arrivals” per stop  
- “Notify me at X minutes” alerts  
- Fallback ETA when GPS is unavailable

**Quotes (anonymized)**  


**Prototype → Test**  
- v0: static schedule + looping demo bus  
- Feedback: prioritize alerts and ETA clarity over detailed map chrome  
- v1: watch-stop alert, headway fallback, a11y, high-contrast

**Metrics for success**  
- Avg wait time ↓ (target 30–50%)  
- Missed rides ↓  
- On-time arrivals ↑  
- Weekly active users (adoption)

**Next steps (1-week pilot)**  
- Collect actual timings + 30-sec feedback form  
- Validate ETA SLA with ops; wire data feed  
- Iterate on notifications and reliability
